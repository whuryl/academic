Ruan-Yanlin received an M.S. degree in the major of control theory and control engineering from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in communication and information systems at Wuhan University. His research interests mainly include indoor positioning and navigation technology, signal processing, and machine learning. He used to be an embedded R&D engineer of ZTE and a university teacher majoring in electrical and electronic information.

LIESMARS at a Glance
======
The State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University (LIESMARS) is the first state key laboratory in the field of surveying and mapping in China. In 1989, the laboratory began construction on the basis of the National Key Disciplines of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing and Geodetic of Wuhan Technology University of Surveying and Mapping. It was formally approved by the State Development Planning Commission in the same year. In 1991, when the World Bank loan was launched, the laboratory became one of the seven tracking demonstration laboratories of the World Bank in China. In 1992, the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping launched an open research fund, and the laboratory was officially opened to the outside world. In 1995, the laboratory passed the joint inspection organized by the State Education Commission, the State Planning Commission, and the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping. In 2004, the laboratory was awarded the title of advanced collective and won the "Golden Bull Award" at the awarding ceremony for the 20th anniversary of the construction of the State Key Laboratory held by the Ministry of Science and Technology and other ministries and commissions. In evaluations conducted by the Ministry of Science and Technology, LIESMARS was consecutively ranked "Excellent" in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015.

The director of LIESMARS is Prof. Chen Ruizhi. The chairman of the academic committee of LIESMARS is Prof. Li Deren, who is an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Engineering.
The laboratory follows the principle of modest scale of development. According to the needs of discipline development, it expands the research direction and continuously introduces high-level talents. There is 121 permanent personnel in LIESMARS, including 106 researchers. Among them, there are three academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Engineering, 80 professors, 21 associate professors, 105 doctoral students, and 64 young and middle-aged technological personnel under the age of 45.

The current research institutes are Research Institute of Aerial and Space Photography; Research Institute of Remote Sensing Information Processing; Research Institute of Geospatial Information Systems and Services; Research Institute of 3S Integration and Network Communication; Research Institute of Navigation and Location-based Services.

Under the requirements of the "national team" in the relevant field, following the tenet of "opening, flowing, uniting, and competition" of the national key laboratories, LIESMARS is united, hard-working, innovative, enterprising. With progressive academic ideas, remarkable scientific research, a complete independent innovation system, and extensive academic exchanges, LIESMARS has become one of the centers for fundamental theoretical research and applied basic research in the field of mapping and remote sensing in China and the world. Great achievements have been made in scientific research, team building, personnel training, a transformation of high-tech achievements, and external academic exchanges.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
