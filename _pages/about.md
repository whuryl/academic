　　She walks in beauty， like the night

　　她走在美的光彩中，像夜晚；

　　Of cloudless climes and starry skies

　　皎洁无云并且繁星漫天；

　　And all that's best of dark and bright

　　黑夜与白天最美妙的色彩；

　　Meet in her aspect and her eyes

　　都在她的面容和目光里显现。

LIESMARS at a Glance
======
The State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing (LIESMARS), Wuhan University, was founded in 1989, and the first state key laboratory in the field of surveying and mapping in China. In evaluations conducted by the Ministry of Science and Technology, LIESMARS was consecutively ranked Excellent in 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015, and was presented with the Golden Bull Award in 2004.

The director of LIESMARS is Prof. Chen Ruizhi. The chairman of academic committee of LIESMARS is Prof. Li Deren, who is an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Engineering.

The laboratory follows the principle of modest scale of development. According to the needs of discipline development, it expands the research direction and continuously introduces high-level talents. There are 121 permanent personnel in LIESMARS, including 106 researchers. Among them, there are 3 academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Engineering, 80 professors, 21 associate professors, 105 doctoral students, and 64 young and middle-aged technological personnel under the age of 45.

The current research institutes are: Research Institute of Aerial and Space Photography; Research Institute of Remote Sensing Information Processing; Research Institute of Geospatial Information Systems and Services; Research Institute of 3S Integration and Network Communication; Research Institute of Navigation and Location-based Services.

In accordance with the requirements of the ‘national team’ in the relevant field, following the tenet of ‘opening, flowing, uniting, and competition’ of the national key laboratories, LIESMARS is united, hard-working, innovative, enterprising. With active academic ideas, remarkable scientific research, a complete independent innovation system, and extensive academic exchanges, LIESMARS has become one of the centers for fundamental theoretical research and applied basic research in the field of mapping and remote sensing in China and the world. Great achievements have been made in scientific research, team building, personnel training, transformation of high-tech achievements, and external academic exchanges.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](http://ruanyanlin.cn/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/ruanyanlin.cn/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
